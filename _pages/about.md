The Neural Systems and Neuromodulation Lab develops targeted approaches to characterise and shape brain dynamics. We integrate computational modelling with multimodal neuroimaging (EEG, MRI) and brain stimulation techniques to investigate how modulation of specific brain regions and circuits influences neural activity and behaviour. Our work bridges mechanistic neuroscience and clinical translation, with the goal of developing evidence-based neurotechnology interventions for neurological and psychiatric conditions. Current research projects focus on memory consolidation, sleep regulation, epilepsy, mood disorders, and depression.
